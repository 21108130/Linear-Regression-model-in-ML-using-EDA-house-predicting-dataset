# Housing Prices Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze housing prices to help the local government make informed decisions about urban development and housing policies. We developed a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features of the houses.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection
We collected housing data from publicly available sources such as Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes features like:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Age of the house
- House price

### 2. Dataset Exploration
We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data better:
1. Summary Statistics: We looked at basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for each feature.
2. Missing Values: We checked for any missing values in the data.
3. Distributions: We plotted histograms to see the distribution of each feature.
4. Correlations: We calculated the correlation between features and house prices to see which features are strongly related to prices.
5. Scatter Plots: We created scatter plots to visualize the relationship between each feature and house price.

### 3. Model Training
We used the following steps to train our model:
1. Feature Selection: We chose relevant features that are likely to influence house prices.
2. Data Standardization: We scaled the features so they have similar ranges.
3. Gradient Descent: We trained a linear regression model using gradient descent, an iterative method to find the best-fit line. We chose a learning rate and number of iterations to ensure the model converges.

### 4. Closed Form Solution
We also solved the linear regression problem using the normal equation (closed-form solution). This method calculates the best-fit line in one step without iteration. We compared the results of gradient descent with the closed-form solution and found them to be similar.

### 5. Model Evaluation
We evaluated our model to see how well it performs:
1. Data Split: We split the data into training and test sets.
2. Model Evaluation: We made predictions on both sets and calculated metrics like Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) and R-squared. These metrics help us understand the model's accuracy and how well it generalizes to new data.

### 6. Overfitting and Complexity
To address overfitting and model complexity, we followed these steps:
1. Definition of Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on test data.
2. Regularization: We used regularization techniques like Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) to prevent overfitting. These techniques add a penalty for large coefficients, which helps to keep the model simpler and more generalizable.
3. Cross-Validation: We used cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters (e.g., the regularization strength) and ensure our model performs well on unseen data.
4. Model Complexity: We monitored the complexity of the model by observing the size of the coefficients. Regularization helps in keeping the model simple, thus reducing the risk of overfitting.
